# Te Ship o' Maelstorm!
Abandon all hope ye who enter the treacherous realms of the seven seas, for ye be about te see the wrath of math, the monstrosity of types, the fury of OCaml. The Ship of Maelstorm fer programming languages an' some experiments leaves no witness! Ye shall drown ye who are of not pure heart!
